# SnakeBytes: Journaling the Journey of Learning Python, Bit by Bit, Byte by Byte 🐍

Welcome to **SnakeBytes**, a thoughtfully curated collection of Python notebooks that chronicles the journey of mastering Python programming. The repository is an evolving archive, growing with each concept learned, each problem tackled, and each byte of knowledge gained.

## 🌟 Objective

The primary aim of this project is to document the process of learning Python, showcasing both foundational concepts and advanced techniques. **SnakeBytes** serves as a resource for:
- **Beginners** seeking a structured pathway to learn Python.
- **Learners** looking to deepen their understanding with practical examples.
- **Enthusiasts** revisiting key concepts in Python.

## 📂 Folder Structure and Highlights

The repository is organized into categories and subcategories for easy navigation:
